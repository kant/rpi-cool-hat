# rpi-cool-hat

Raspberry Pi 4 introduced conflicting demands when producing music:

* Cooling gets mandatory to avoid throttling
* For high quality audio a soundcard HAT is required

Since most (all?) cooling solutions do not allow stacked HATs this KiCad project suggests an adapter PCB as:

RPi is connected right / HAT connected left (upside-down) / cooler's fan connected to pins in the back

Note that project:

* was created by Kicad 5.1.5 as shipped by Fedora 30
* is in early stage: Nothing soldered / no tests performed yet
